# Abnormal Human Activity Detection

This repository contains a Python-based project aimed at detecting abnormal human activities using computer vision techniques and machine learning. The primary focus of this project is to identify specific actions such as crawling, crouching, and choking in real-time, leveraging the capabilities of the MediaPipe library for pose estimation.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilize live camera input or video files for monitoring and detecting abnormal activities.
- **Pose Estimation**: Implement MediaPipe's pose estimation to accurately track human body landmarks.
- **Activity Recognition**: Detect specific activities like crawling, crouching, and potential choking scenarios based on the positions of key body joints.
- **Logging System**: Maintain a log of detected activities for further analysis and debugging.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DynamicChase/Abnormal-Human-Activity-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Abnormal-Human-Activity-Detection
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start detecting activities:
```bash
python main.py
```
You can adjust parameters such as detection thresholds and frame rates within the code to suit your specific needs.
